# React-APIs

You can also access API services from React.  This example will show you how easy it is to mix fetch calls with React to display the data.  In this tutorial, we will show you how to access the Utah cities API service from your React application.

1. First create your index.html file with a form where the user can type in the first letters of a city:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">  
    class CityForm extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {value: ''};
    
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
      }
    
      handleChange(event) {
        alert('A name was changed: ' + event.target.value);
        this.setState({value: event.target.value});
      }
    
      handleSubmit(event) {
        alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    
      render() {
        return (
            <div>
            <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit} onKeyUp={this.handleChange}>
            <label>
              Name:
              <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
            </form>
            </div>
        );
      }
    }
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<CityForm />);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
Notice that we are going to capture the keyup event and will call 'handleChange' when this occurs.  The state variable 'value' will contain the characters that have been typed into the box. We have inserted an extra ```<div>``` around the form so we can add a list in the next step.  Test your code to make sure that you see the alert box every time you type a character in the form.

2. Now add an array of cities to your state.  We are trying to mimic the API here by creating an array of objects that is similar to the JSON array that the API will return.

```jsx
        this.state = {value: '', cities:[{"city":"Provo"},{"city":"Lindon"}]};
```
3. And add code at the top of render to create the list.
```jsx
        const listItems = this.state.cities.map((cityname) => 
          <li key={cityname.city}>{cityname.city}</li>
        );
```
4. Then add code to display the list below the form.  Test your code to make sure that the list of cities is displayed below the form.
```jsx
            <ul>{listItems}</ul>
```
4. Now add the code to fetch the cities that start with 'prefix' from the REST service. Once the data has been returned, the 'then' promise calls the 'json()' promise to convert the json to a javascript array.  Since this is an asynchronous call, we add another 'then' when the conversion completes.  At this point, the 'cities' array is truncated and the cities from the REST service are pushed onto the 'cities' array.  They will then be displayed with the mustache syntax in the render.
```jsx
        var url = "https://csonline.byu.edu/city?q=" + event.target.value;
        console.log("URL " + url);
        fetch(url)
          .then((data) => {
            return (data.json());
          })
          .then((citylist) => {
            console.log("CityList");
            console.log(citylist);
            this.setState({cities:citylist})
            console.log(this.state.cities);
          });
```
